# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

A back end project setting up request and response processes for the database along with model schema requirements. User authorization was touched upon and learning how to test through Postman was extensive.

In this project we used Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and validator.
Express was used to handle data sent from the user, MongoDB to set up the database, Mongoose to set up schemas, and validator to validate input URLs.
